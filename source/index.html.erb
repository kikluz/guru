    <h1>Welcome friend!</h1>
    <p>
      Here you will find links to Bernadette’s website where you can buy her books.
    </p>
    <p>
      I started this page because my friends had tremendous difficulty understanding her latest book, The Real Christ.  This page is not endorsed by Bernadette or her friends. 
    </p> 
    <p>
      The audio samples below were taken from one of her last small group discussions on The Real Christ. 
    </p>
    <p>
      They are not copyrighted yet  i don’t have her permission to use them.  I tried to edit out everyone else’s voices because i don’t have their permission either. I believe her work is so important for humanity that i need to get her ideas in her own words out there.
    </p>

    <p>
      Listen to them a few times.   She is probably not saying what you think she is saying.  She is a very original thinker.  Feel free to dance!
